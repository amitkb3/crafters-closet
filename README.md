##Welcome to Crafter's Closet!
I built Crafter's Closet to be a personal inventory tool for DIY/hobby/art supplies of all kinds. It tracks how many craft supplies a user owns and figures out what they should buy to build a new project. Authenticated users have access to a dashboard where they can filter and search their inventory, add new supplies, update existing supplies, view a chart of the supply types they own, and view a list of their projects. When creating a project page, a user gives general project details and a list of supplies needed to build the project. When an authenticated user views a project page, Crafter's Closet shows how many of each required supply the user would need to buy. Any user can also search the Crafter's Closet project pages to find fun crafts to make.
